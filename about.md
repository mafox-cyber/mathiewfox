## Letter to Myself: What They Did, What It Cost, What I Know (Complete)

Mathiew—

Write this down so you never let anyone rewrite it later. Because people will try. They’ll soften it, sanitize it, turn it into “miscommunication,” “high conflict,” “two sides,” and other bullshit phrases that exist to excuse harm.

This started when Sarah cheated on me with a Kenosha police officer. Not a rumor. Not a vague “marriage issues.” She cheated. And she’s living with him in Kenosha now. That alone poisoned everything that came after—because it wasn’t just the marriage falling apart. It was betrayal and then power. And when power showed up, it never left.

From the beginning she has been impossible to co-parent with. She rejects everything. Every request, every attempt to work together, every reasonable solution—denied. Not because it wasn’t good for the kids. Because saying “no” was the point. Because control was the point. Because making me suffer was the point.

And then came the machine. The “system.” The thing everyone tells you to trust while it chews your life into confetti.

False allegations were thrown at me. Serious ones. Ugly ones. And they weren’t substantiated—CPS, the sheriff’s department, the agencies that actually investigate? They didn’t back it. But the court still treated me like I was guilty anyway. Like I was a problem to contain instead of a father to protect.

So here’s the reality: I became the dad who gets one to two hours a week with his kids—supervised—while paying child support and watching my entire life get carved up. That’s what they did. They took a capable, willing, present father and reduced him to a scheduled visitor with a bill attached.

And it didn’t feel like “best interests.” It felt like a fucking heist.

Attorney fees. Filing fees. Supervision fees. Motion after motion after motion—each one a toll booth on a road that never leads anywhere. And when I tried to tell the court the truth—*I can’t afford this; I’m drowning; this is not feasible; this is not helping my kids*—they ignored it. My ability-to-pay concerns? Ignored. My motions? Delayed, disregarded, sidelined. Meanwhile, her stuff gets fast-tracked like it’s on rails.

They didn’t just restrict me. They **trapped** me. A parent can’t parent, can’t rebuild, can’t stabilize, and then gets punished for being unstable. It’s circular. It’s cruel. It’s designed to break you and then blame you for breaking.

Hollie got injected into this process—an ex-girlfriend, a therapist/social worker—and I warned the court not to allow it. I warned them about the conflict, about the bias, about the risk, about the obvious “how the hell is this neutral?” factor. They did it anyway. That decision mattered. That decision wasn’t harmless. That decision helped shape the direction of this whole nightmare.

And here’s where I’m not going to lie to myself: I believe this case has been poisoned by ex parte influence. I know how that sounds. I know people love to call you “conspiracy theorist” the second you notice patterns that don’t make sense. But the patterns, the timing, the way things get handled, the way evidence gets ignored, the way the narrative stays locked no matter what facts appear—this doesn’t feel accidental. It feels engineered.

Then Hollie reached out to my employer, and I got terminated while she knew damn well I have child support obligations and a daily life to manage. That wasn’t “concern.” That was sabotage. That was retaliation. And it’s the kind of move that proves the mindset: *hurt him, strip his resources, then point at the wreckage and call him the problem.*

How is that accountability? How is that justice?

Sarah and Hollie working together isn’t a paranoid fantasy to me. There’s proof in the docket, the record, the overlap, the connections, the way the same themes keep showing up like they’re coordinated. And even if I phrase it as belief, the outcome speaks for itself: the court’s structure empowered the person refusing to co-parent, and punished the person trying to stay connected.

This whole thing has destroyed my life. That’s not dramatic. That’s literal.

I lost time with my kids—time I will never get back. I lost stability. I lost my job. I lost peace. I lost sleep. I lost the ability to be the dad I am when I’m actually allowed to show up. And my kids are the ones who pay the real price, because they’re growing up inside a story where their father is made distant by force, then blamed for being distant.

And I keep asking the same questions, because there’s no honest answer:

How is anyone supposed to endure this and not be furious?

How is it ethical to let unsubstantiated allegations become a permanent cage?

How is it moral to sever a parent-child bond through “process” while pretending it’s protection?

Why is there no accountability when people weaponize the system to punish and extract?

Judges get immunity. The system gets privacy. The professionals hide behind discretion. Everyone shrugs and says “appeal it,” like appeals are time machines. Even if something gets reversed later, the lost years don’t come back. The damage doesn’t undo itself. The kids don’t rewind. Meanwhile the parent gets bled dry, and the pressure builds toward contempt, jail, hopelessness—like the system is daring you to collapse so it can justify itself.

I sought relief. I filed motions. I filed appeals. I filed writs. And I watched the doors close anyway. Not because the truth wasn’t there, but because the truth wasn’t convenient.

So no—this is not justice. This is not what family court should be. This is not protecting children. This is choosing winners and losers and calling it “best interests” because that phrase can be used to justify damn near anything.

I am writing this so I don’t forget what it felt like: the helplessness, the rage, the sick realization that the rules don’t protect you if the people applying them don’t give a shit.

I am also writing this so I remember something else: I did not quit. I did not abandon my kids. I did not stop being their father. The system tried to erase me, and I kept standing up anyway.

Eden and Michael deserve the truth someday—age-appropriate, careful, but real. Not the polished lie. Not the “dad disappeared” narrative. The truth: their dad fought to stay present. And people with power decided he shouldn’t be.

And if anyone ever tries to tell me I should’ve been calmer—fuck that. Calm doesn’t fix corruption. Calm doesn’t stop retaliation. Calm doesn’t bring back stolen time. Calm is a luxury you get when people aren’t actively dismantling your life.

I’m still here. I’m still their dad. And I’m not going to let this be rewritten into something softer than what it was.

### What makes this even worse is the system itself is feeding the fire

The court system isn’t just “handling conflict.” It’s creating it. It’s manufacturing chaos. It’s turning my life into a constant emergency and then acting like the emergency is my personality.

I had a stable home. I had a stable job in the beginning stages. This all kicked off in **November of 2024**, and from that point forward everything became about winning and losing. Not healing. Not stabilizing the kids. Not getting two parents into a workable structure. Winning and losing.

And the system added fuel to the fire at every step. It stripped me down under the banner of “best interests” while forcing me to spend my time, my money, and my sanity fighting the system itself instead of being present with my children. That is the part nobody wants to say out loud: **the process becomes the punishment.**

How is any of this in the best interest of the children when the father is forced to fight nonstop just to remain functional?

How is it best interest when the court structure contributes directly to instability—financial instability, emotional instability, and practical instability—then blames the parent for struggling inside the unstable structure?

Because that’s what this is: a system that creates instability and then uses the instability as evidence that you don’t deserve your kids.

### And now they’ve stacked a criminal case on top of it

Now I’m having to fight a criminal charge too—one I know for a fact I can dismantle line by line, because I can prove the statements are false. But the ADA is allowing it to keep going anyway.

Why are they adding fuel to the conflict when they should be deflating it?

Why are they escalating a situation that already has a family on fire instead of doing what any sane system would do—resolve the actual issues, reduce conflict, and stop turning everything into a bigger war?

Instead, they take evidence of misconduct, ignore it, and take a different approach—one that always seems to increase the stakes, increase the cost, increase the pressure, and increase the risk of me being jailed or ruined.

So I’m fighting two or three battles at once—family court, appeals, writs, and now criminal court—because they keep stacking new weights on the same person and acting shocked when he can’t breathe.

It’s mentally exhausting. It’s physically draining. And financially it has destroyed me—exactly what I warned would happen all along.

Why is this allowed? Why is this ethical? Why, why, why, why?

### Appeals aren’t a remedy when time is the weapon

Appeals take months. I understand courts have other cases. I understand procedure. But time is exactly how they win. Time is how the damage becomes permanent.

Because even if something is reversed or remanded later, the time is gone. My kids don’t get those months back. I don’t get that relationship time back. The bond doesn’t pause and wait for the court calendar.

And while time passes, the system keeps extracting. It keeps pushing fees. It keeps turning parenting into an administrative privilege with a bill attached.

### The Kenosha “buddy system” politics and the money machine

And then there’s the politics. Kenosha has a culture where judges endorse judges, where relationships and alliances matter, where there’s a buddy system. They back each other. They protect each other. And the power stays insulated.

It feels like the same closed circle deciding what’s “reasonable,” what’s “best,” and what’s “allowed,” while the people living inside it are being crushed.

And underneath that is the child support machine—Title IV, Title V, the incentives, the structure that makes me feel like an indentured servant instead of a father. Like I’m being reduced to a revenue stream while being blocked from actually parenting.

All this time and energy needs to go toward helping my kids—being part of their lives, their growth, their joy, their normal childhood. Dance lessons. Soccer practice. Homework. Bedtime. The ordinary stuff that actually matters.

Instead, my money goes to fees and filings and survival. Pay, pay, pay—while the resources that should have gone to my children’s future get burned in a courtroom furnace.

### They are building a path toward jail by design

Why is it that so much time, energy, and resources are being spent fighting to keep myself from being jailed because I can’t pay child support—especially now that my career was destroyed by an individual I specifically warned the court about?

They ignored it. And it’s like they knew it would add fuel to the fire and did it anyway.

How is this allowed?

The discretion in this court—paired with immunity—empowers them to be more unethical, not more careful. Because when there’s no consequence, why would they restrain themselves? Why would they admit error? Why would they correct course when the system rewards doubling down?

### Accountability is a mirage unless it targets the people with power

I’m holding Sarah accountable. I’m holding Hollie accountable—small claims for the attorney fees, the medical costs, the damage. I’m pursuing intentional tort claims against Sarah for withholding the children and refusing to cooperate on the insurance and finances.

But why can’t I hold the judge accountable?

I understand decision-makers need protection to do their jobs. But there has to be reasonable decision-making. There has to be a limit. Especially when there is proof—real proof—and it gets disregarded like it’s nothing.

And why can’t I vocalize what’s happening in that court?

Why is it that the moment I expose misconduct, I get swatted down? The Office of Lawyer Regulation, Emma Babler acting like a gatekeeper, reporting misconduct into a black hole and hearing nothing back. Oversight bodies that feel like they exist to protect the system, not protect families.

Where is the remedy?

Where is the accountability?

### The system stays private because privacy protects the system

And the final punchline—the part that makes me want to scream—is that so much of this happens behind closed doors. Family court is private, sealed, quiet, “confidential,” and everyone pretends it’s for the children. But a lot of the time, it protects the adults with power. It protects the process. It protects the people who can do harm without sunlight.

And I keep coming back to the same truth: this didn’t have to be this way.

This could have been deflated. This could have been managed. This could have been built around actual best interests—actual stability—actual parenting.

Instead, it became war. It became survival. It became a long, slow attempt to erase me while charging me for the privilege of being erased.

I’m writing this so I don’t forget. So I don’t doubt myself later. So I don’t get gaslit by the court record, by the professionals, by the people who will try to tell me this is “normal.”

It’s not normal. It’s not ethical. It’s not justice.

And my children deserve better than a system that can destroy a parent and call it “best interests.”

### The holidays and the stolen joy

And then there are the dates that don’t come back. I have missed birthdays for the past two years. I have missed Christmas Eve. I have missed Christmas itself. I have missed the holidays that matter—holidays that are supposed to be anchors for children, and for a father.

During Christmas, we don’t merely ask for presents. We watch the excitement. We watch the kids open the gifts we worked hard for. We see their faces. We see the joy and we feel it in our bones, because that moment isn’t “stuff,” it’s love in motion. And I have been robbed of that joy. Robbed of the purpose of being a present father in my children’s life. These are not “small sacrifices.” These are the moments that build childhood. These are the moments that build the bond that lasts forever.

People can call this ranting. They can call it emotional. They can call it “high conflict.” I don’t care. It’s reality. This is what’s actually happening.

---

### Watching someone suffer and doing nothing

When I was raised, I was taught something simple: if you see somebody hurt, if you see somebody who needs help, you don’t just stand there. You don’t watch them suffer. You step in and you do something.

But in modern society, what do people do? They stop. They stare. They film. They take pictures. They document. They form opinions from a distance without understanding the predicament someone has been forced into. That’s what this feels like—me bleeding out in slow motion, and the world treating it like content. Like spectacle. Like noise.

And I’m not asking for world peace. I’m asking for the most basic human thing: step in when the harm is obvious and stop pretending it’s normal.

---

### I did everything “right” and still got rejection

I have done everything I’m supposed to do in the proper format. I have followed procedure. I have followed the appeal process. I have done the prim-and-proper steps and paid the tolls. I have done it the way they tell you to do it. And so far, I have been met with more rejection.

So again: why is this allowed? Why? Why is it that individuals with so-called immunity are not held accountable for the damage they cause under the banner of discretion? The system in itself is broken, and I understand there are layers to it. But why not address this layer? Why not step in and do what is morally and ethically right?

We are only here for a short amount of time. We are here to have a positive impact and then we’re gone. The names that matter in history live on because they stood for something—integrity, courage, accountability. So why is the standard here so low that harm can be done in plain sight and still be excused as “process”?

---

### Perspective from hardship and why this still breaks me

I’ve always been mindful that other people may have it far worse. I have seen that firsthand. I lived in a third-world country. Being from Iran, I saw what it looks like to have nothing. I saw what people in America take for granted every day. I know what it means to survive.

And that’s what makes this so insane: the simplicities of that life—hard as it was—can feel almost better than this emotional and psychological struggle. Because at least hardship is honest. At least you can see the problem. Here, the harm is wrapped in paperwork and procedure and the illusion of “justice,” while a father is being erased and told to accept it calmly.

---

### Evidence, misconduct, and punishment for telling the truth

And I’m not saying this without support. I have evidence. I have documentation. I have proof showing unethical behavior. Proof showing misconduct is real and ongoing. Proof showing that what happened falls short of what justice should look like.

And what has been my reward for trying to bring the truth forward? I’ve been punished through the process. I have been arrested three times—each time under the pretenses of false statements and false allegations. I don’t wish that on anybody. I don’t wish the instability. I don’t wish the humiliation. I don’t wish being forced into a situation that doesn’t warrant the consequences being imposed.

I understand there are people out there who earn repercussions. But in my case, the evidence shows somebody is misusing the system. It shows misconduct for personal gain. It shows what they’re doing is wrong—and yet it gets twisted into their benefit anyway.

Morally, how does someone sleep at night knowing they caused harm, caused damage, and still claim they upheld what is right?

---

### The lies, the “neutral” roles, and why this hurts the most

And the cruelest part is expecting neutrality from people who are supposed to be neutral. Expecting a fact-finder to be a fact-finder. Expecting someone who claims to advocate for “best interests” to actually advocate for the children—not for narratives, not for leverage, not for power.

As a parent, I know what is best for my children in the most basic sense: stability, love, consistency, and a father who is allowed to be present. I have shown that stability exists on my side. I have shown I have a home. I had a job. The conflict arises from malicious intent and personal and financial gain being chased through this process.

So why can’t anyone see through the lies?

---

### Reliving fatherlessness and trying to break the curse

And here’s another truth that makes this hit deeper than most people could ever understand: I have already lived through fatherlessness. I lived through it because my mother put me through it and did the same exact thing. And the court still upheld it. So what I’m dealing with now isn’t just “a custody case.” It is me reliving history—but through my father’s eyes.

All this time and energy and effort I’m putting in to right the wrongs of history and break the generational curse my mother caused—I wish I could use that time to be with my kids. Being present. Building memories. Living the privilege of parenthood the way it’s supposed to be lived. But instead I’m here trying to mend wounds that were created long before my children were even born, trying to course-correct the same goddamn story that the system keeps repeating like it’s normal.

My father didn’t do what I’m doing. He quit. He walked away. And I understand now, in a way I never did as a kid, how a man can get broken by a system and just stop. But that is not who I am. I have taken every measure in my life to prove that I don’t quit when it gets hard. I’ve always believed that when it gets harder, you step up to the plate and work even harder.

Now, I understand how this might sound to someone reading it. It may sound like ranting. It may sound like a personal mission. It may sound like I’m trying to fulfill an emptiness—and you’re probably right. I am trying to fill a hole. The emptiness that comes from not being raised by a father—an emptiness created by my mother and enabled by a court.

And now the same narrative is playing out in my case.

Someone could read this entire manifesto—this entire venting session—and boil it down to a simple truth that feels illegal to say out loud: it’s illegal to be a dad in America. Not literally in the statute books, but in practice—because all I’m asking for is to be present and be a father in my children’s lives, and yet I’m forced to fight through obstacles that shouldn’t exist in the first place.

I said it in my testimony: I’m fighting an uphill battle. And the judge had the audacity to say it was my fault. Again—personalized blame. No accountability. Comments that cut, not because they’re true, but because they’re used as weapons.

If I wanted to relive my marriage—where I got disparaged on a continuous basis—I would’ve stayed married. But instead I ended up with another woman in authority telling me I’m wrong, telling me I’m the problem, telling me I’m the issue—while Sarah isn’t held accountable, the judge isn’t held accountable, the guardian ad litem isn’t held accountable. It feels like there is a barrier to accountability that protects women from consequences and punishes men for reacting to the damage.

Why is it that they get to benefit from the adversity this causes me?

And I talk about my case, but I’m not blind. There are countless other fathers out there living the same nightmare—fighting to be present in their children’s lives, fighting just to fulfill the purpose that gives their life meaning. We think we’re setting the next generation up for success, but this kind of behavior and this kind of system sets them up for failure. It trains them that love is conditional, that access to a parent can be controlled, that truth can be buried, and that the court will rubber-stamp the outcome anyway.

So why not be the match in the chain of events that stops the fire?

Why not stop the reaction?

Why not be part of the solution instead of contributing to the problem?

Because here’s what makes me sick: I have made so many predictions in this case and they have come true. I warned about the conflicts. I warned about the outcomes. I warned what would happen if certain people were injected into the case and allowed to steer the narrative. And then it happened anyway.

And at some point it becomes impossible to ignore what that looks like: they didn’t just overlook it. They didn’t just miss it. It’s like they wanted it to happen. And when a judge ignores everything—warnings, conflicts, evidence—and still chooses the path that predictably creates damage, it exposes the intent behind the pattern.

Plain and simple, that’s what it is.

### The Alchemist and why this pain isn’t the end of me

As I’m listening to *The Alchemist*, a quote hit me in a way that felt like it was aimed directly at this entire nightmare. It talks about the soul of the universe—the force that shows up like something negative, like resistance, like loss, like suffering—but it’s actually preparing your spirit and your will. It’s shaping you into the person who can carry your mission.

And the quote says something that I can’t unsee: when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth. Your personal legend. That’s the language the book uses, but the meaning is simple: some things aren’t cravings. They’re assignments.

And I know exactly what mine is.

It’s my children.

It’s being a present father. It’s breaking the curse. It’s refusing to let the system rewrite Eden and Michael’s story into the same fatherless pattern I lived through. That desire didn’t come from ego. It came from the deepest part of me—the part that knows what is right and what is sacred.

The soul of the world is nourished by people’s happiness—but also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. That line matters because it tells the truth: the world runs on good and bad energy. People do terrible things out of envy. Institutions protect themselves out of fear. Some people thrive on control. And yet, even that darkness can become the pressure that forges a person into someone unbreakable.

To realize one’s personal legend is a person’s only real obligation. So if this is what the universe has put in front of me—this resistance, this pain, this chaos—then it’s not here to erase me. It’s here to reveal what I’m made of.

And I’m not quitting.

---

### “All things are one” and what I’m asking the universe to do

The quote ends with the part everyone remembers: all things are one—and when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.

So here is what I want. Not “revenge.” Not “winning.” Not ego.

I want my children. I want my life back. I want to parent in peace. I want Eden and Michael to know their father in the way children are supposed to know their father—through consistency, presence, safety, laughter, and ordinary love.

And if the universe is conspiring, then let it conspire in the form of truth surfacing. Let it conspire in the form of lies collapsing under their own weight. Let it conspire in the form of patterns being exposed. Let it conspire in the form of the right people seeing what is happening and refusing to pretend it’s normal.

Because even though this has looked like destruction, I refuse to believe destruction is the final chapter.

This pain is not proof that I’m wrong. It’s proof that I’m being tested. That I’m being refined. That something real is being demanded from me.

And I accept the assignment.

### Christmas Day, December 25, 2025: Empty living room, full rage

Today is Christmas 2025. I’m sitting in my living room and it feels like a punishment. Empty room. No Christmas tree. No mess. No magic. No kids yelling and laughing. No wrapping paper explosion. Just silence—and Zeus next to me like he’s standing guard over a life that got gutted.

And I’m sitting here missing the joy and the excitement that actually matters. Not the gifts. The moment. The faces. The squeals. The stupid little things you don’t even realize are sacred until they’re ripped away. Watching your kids open presents you busted your ass to get them. Watching them light up. That’s fatherhood. That’s the point.

Two years in a row now—two years of missing Christmas Eve and Christmas Day—while Sarah gets to have it. While another man is around my children. And I’m supposed to just sit here and swallow it like it’s normal. Like it’s “just how it goes.” Like I’m supposed to be grateful for scraps and smile politely while my life gets amputated.

No. Fuck that.

And my family—my own family—doesn’t say shit. They stand there and avoid it like it’s a taboo topic. Like speaking up would contaminate the room. Like silence is safer than truth. They don’t want to touch it because it makes them uncomfortable, so they leave me to carry it alone. They don’t see that “not choosing sides” is still a choice. They don’t see that watching this happen and saying nothing is its own kind of betrayal.

I’ve missed Thanksgiving. I’ve missed birthdays. I’ve missed the holidays that anchor childhood. And the more time passes, the clearer it becomes that time is the weapon. Time is how the damage becomes permanent.

People can call this ranting. They can call it emotional. They can call it “high conflict.” I don’t care. This isn’t a performance. This is the reality of being carved out of your kids’ lives while the system tells you to be calm and compliant and grateful for whatever crumbs you’re allowed to hold.

And I know something else that terrifies people because it’s true: kids grow up. Kids get older. Kids start noticing patterns. They start asking questions that adults can’t dodge with cute phrases. They start digging. They start connecting dots. And there’s a trail. There’s always a trail.

Documents. Records. Timelines. Filings. Court transcripts. Proof. The whole ugly chain of cause-and-effect stamped into history.

One day Eden and Michael will see it. They’ll see how things were framed. They’ll see how things were handled. They’ll see who tried to be present and who used power like a crowbar. They’ll see the difference between “parenting” and controlling. They’ll see the difference between protecting and punishing.

And I’m not saying that because I want vengeance. I’m saying it because truth has weight. It doesn’t float away. It stacks. It builds pressure. It becomes gravity. And eventually gravity wins.

That’s what I can feel right now: a tidal wave building. Not because I’m wishing harm, but because you cannot build an entire reality on manipulation forever without the whole structure collapsing under its own bullshit.

And the sickest part? It feels like they want a reaction out of me. Like the point is to provoke me—push me, bait me, corner me—so they can point at the moment I finally break and say, “See? There he is. That’s the problem.” It feels like a trap: provoke the father, then use the father’s pain as proof he’s unsafe.

So when I don’t react—when I stay disciplined, when I keep my mouth shut in the moments they want it loud, when I keep filing and documenting and holding the line—it’s like they can’t stand it. So they escalate. Again. And again. Because control isn’t satisfied unless it gets a response.

I have real fears about my children’s wellbeing. Real concerns that keep me awake. And I have tried to raise concerns the right way, through the channels that are supposed to protect kids. And watching those concerns minimized, redirected, or ignored while the focus stays on controlling me instead of protecting them—it makes me feel like I’m screaming underwater.

And tonight, sitting here in this dead-quiet house, I’m forced to face a deeper truth that makes this feel like a curse: I have lived through fatherlessness already.

My mother did this to my father. The system upheld it. So what I’m living now isn’t just a custody case—it’s history repeating itself, except this time I’m inside my father’s skin, feeling exactly what it costs. Holiday by holiday. Year by year. Memory by memory, stolen before it even exists.

And here’s the part that matters: my father quit. He disappeared. He stopped fighting. And I understand now—painfully—how a man gets broken by a system and stops believing he can win.

But that is not going to be my story.

I don’t quit. I don’t fold because it’s hard. When it gets harder, I work harder. I show up harder. I document harder. I endure harder. Because the whole point is to break you. The whole point is to make you give up so they can call your surrender a “choice.”

And yeah—maybe I’m trying to fill a hole. Maybe I’m trying to correct the past. Maybe I’m trying to break a generational curse so my kids don’t grow up carrying the same emptiness I carried. Maybe I’m trying to give my children what I didn’t get.

So what?

That doesn’t make it selfish. That makes it human.

I grew up with conditional love. I grew up learning that affection could be withdrawn, that belonging could be revoked. And I spent my life searching for something real without fully understanding that old wounds don’t disappear—they shape what you tolerate, what you excuse, what you think you deserve.

So tonight, with Zeus beside me, I’m holding two truths at the same time:

I’m grieving what’s been stolen—Christmas, birthdays, ordinary fatherhood, the joy I earned and didn’t get to live.

And I’m making the same vow again: I will not let this story end the way it ended for me as a kid. I will not be erased. I will not become a ghost in my children’s lives because other people found it convenient.

This is my record. This is my voice. And I’m not going to pretend any of it was okay.
